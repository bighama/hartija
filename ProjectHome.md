# Hartija - Css Print Framework #

**[This project has been permanently moved to GitHub](https://github.com/vladocar/Hartija---CSS-Print-Framework)**

Recently I had a client who wanted to improve the printing layout for his web site. I made mini case analysing various web printing techniques and how different web sites site manage "**printer friendly**" pages.

The Study and analysis of different CSS methods for web printing brought me to a discovery that many important web sites are not optimized for printing, even the kind that can be done with little effort.

To solve this problem I decided to make **universal Cascading Style Sheets for web printing** by uniting all best CSS printing practises into one.

What is CSS Framework?

"A CSS framework is a library that is meant to allow for easier, more standards-compliant styling of a webpage using the Cascading Style Sheets language. Just like programming and scripting language libraries, CSS frameworks package a number of ready-made options for designing and outlaying a webpage." - [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS_framework)

**How to use this Framework?**

Just use it like normal CSS:

`<link rel="stylesheet" href="print.css" type="text/css" media="print">`

Important: **media** set to **"print"**

When you print the browser will use the stylesheet defined for printing.
